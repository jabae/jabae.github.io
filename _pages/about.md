Alexander Bae is a Research scientist at Zetta AI. He received PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Neuroscience from Princeton University, where he was advised by Dr. Sebastian Seung. He received BS in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

His research focuses on connectomics using Electron Microscopy (EM). His research utilizes 3D EM image stacks to reconstruct the neural circuit and organelles using artificial intelligence and relates derived structural properties to functional properties to provide insights on how the neural circuit in the brain operates. During his PhD, his research was concentrated on mouse visual system, and his postdoc work involves comparing various developmental stages in _C_. _elegans_.
