Alexander Bae is a neuroscientist who solves neuroscience problems using tools from artificial intelligence. He received his PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering and Neuroscience from Princeton University under the mentorship of Dr. Sebastian Seung. He received BS in Electrical Engineering from Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST).

His research focuses on predicting neural circuit function from structure through connectomics. By leveraging AI to reconstruct neural circuits and organelles from 3D biological images, such as electron microscopy, he aims to decode how specific structural patterns give rise to neuronal activity, leading to behavioral output of the system. He works across diverse animal models, from _C_. _elegans_ to mouse, to gain insight on how the neural circuit in the brain operates.
