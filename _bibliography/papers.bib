abstract = {When 3D electron microscopy and calcium imaging are used to investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, the resulting datasets pose new challenges of visualization and interpretation. Here, we present a new kind of digital resource that encompasses almost 400 ganglion cells from a single patch of mouse retina. An online “museum” provides a 3D interactive view of each cell’s anatomy, as well as graphs of its visual responses. The resource reveals two aspects of the retina’s inner plexiform layer: an arbor segregation principle governing structure along the light axis and a density conservation principle governing structure in the tangential plane. Structure is related to visual function; ganglion cells with arbors near the layer of ganglion cell somas are more sustained in their visual responses on average. Our methods are potentially applicable to dense maps of neuronal anatomy and physiology in other parts of the nervous system.},

With the basic architecture of the nervous system preserved, structural changes in neurons, large or small, were closely associated with connectivity changes, which in turn evoked dauer-specific behaviors such as nictation. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant dauer-specific rewiring of sensory neuron connectivity and increased clustering within motor neurons in the dauer connectome. We suggest that the nervous system in the nematode has evolved to respond to harsh environments by developing a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated connectome.},

abstract = {Abstract As an animal matures, its neural circuit undergoes alterations, yet the developmental changes in intracellular organelles to facilitate these changes is less understood. Using 3D electron microscopy and deep learning, the study develops semi-automated methods for reconstructing mitochondria in C. elegans and collected mitochondria reconstructions from normal reproductive stages and dauer, enabling comparative study on mitochondria structure within the neuromuscular system. It is found that various mitochondria structural properties in neurons correlate with synaptic connections and these properties are preserved across development in different neural circuits. To test the necessity of these universal mitochondria properties, the study examines the behavior in drp-1 mutants with impaired mitochondria fission and discovers that it causes behavioral deficits. Moreover, it is observed that dauer neurons display distinctive mitochondrial features, and mitochondria in dauer muscles exhibit unique reticulum-like structure. It is proposed that these specialized mitochondria structures may serve as an adaptive mechanism to support stage-specific behavioral and physiological needs.},

abstract={Understanding the brain requires understanding neurons' functional responses to the circuit architecture shaping them. Here we introduce the MICrONS functional connectomics dataset with dense calcium imaging of around 75,000 neurons in primary visual cortex (VISp) and higher visual areas (VISrl, VISal and VISlm) in an awake mouse that is viewing natural and synthetic stimuli. These data are co-registered with an electron microscopy reconstruction containing more than 200,000 cells and 0.5 billion synapses. Proofreading of a subset of neurons yielded reconstructions that include complete dendritic trees as well the local and inter-areal axonal projections that map up to thousands of cell-to-cell connections per neuron. Released as an open-access resource, this dataset includes the tools for data retrieval and analysis1,2. Accompanying studies describe its use for comprehensive characterization of cell types3--6, a synaptic level connectivity diagram of a cortical column4, and uncovering cell-type-specific inhibitory connectivity that can be linked to gene expression data4,7. Functionally, we identify new computational principles of how information is integrated across visual space8, characterize novel types of neuronal invariances9 and bring structure and function together to uncover a general principle for connectivity between excitatory neurons within and across areas10,11.},

Proofreading of whole-brain automated reconstructions will require many person-years of effort, due to the huge volumes of data involved. Here we present FlyWire, an online community for proofreading neural circuits in a Drosophila melanogaster brain and explain how its computational and social structures are organized to scale up to whole-brain connectomics. Browser-based three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible to distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually anywhere in the world. Information in the edit history is programmatically accessible for a variety of uses such as estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive systems. An open community accelerates proofreading by recruiting more participants and accelerates scientific discovery by requiring information sharing.

abstract="Electron microscopy (EM) enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at the level of individual synapses, which has been transformative for scientific discoveries. However, due to the complex morphology, an accurate reconstruction of cortical axons has become a major challenge. Worse still, there is no publicly available large-scale EM dataset from the cortex that provides dense ground truth segmentation for axons, making it difficult to develop and evaluate large-scale axon reconstruction methods. To address this, we introduce the AxonEM dataset, which consists of two 30 x 30 x 30 μm3 EM image volumes from the human and mouse cortex, respectively. We thoroughly proofread over 18,000 axon instances to provide dense 3D axon instance segmentation, enabling large-scale evaluation of axon reconstruction methods. In addition, we densely annotate nine ground truth subvolumes for training, per each data volume. With this, we reproduce two published state-of-the-art methods and provide their evaluation results as a baseline. We publicly release our code and data at https://connectomics-bazaar.github.io/proj/AxonEM/index.html to foster the development of advanced methods.",

Most of the automated segmentation methods label voxels rather than producing neuron skeletons directly. A further skeletonization step is necessary for quantitative morphological analysis. Currently, several tools are published for skeletonization as well as morphological and synaptic connectivity analysis using different computer languages and environments. Recently the Julia programming language, notable for elegant syntax and high performance, has gained rapid adoption in the scientific computing community. Here, we present a Julia package, called RealNeuralNetworks.jl, for efficient sparse skeletonization, morphological analysis, and synaptic connectivity analysis. Based on a large-scale Zebrafish segmentation dataset, we illustrate the software features by performing distributed skeletonization in Google Cloud, clustering the neurons using the NBLAST algorithm, combining morphological similarity and synaptic connectivity to study their relationship. We demonstrate that RealNeuralNetworks.jl is suitable for use in terabyte-scale electron microscopy image segmentation datasets.",

Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.",
