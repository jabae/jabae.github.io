abstract = {When 3D electron microscopy and calcium imaging are used to investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, the resulting datasets pose new challenges of visualization and interpretation. Here, we present a new kind of digital resource that encompasses almost 400 ganglion cells from a single patch of mouse retina. An online “museum” provides a 3D interactive view of each cell’s anatomy, as well as graphs of its visual responses. The resource reveals two aspects of the retina’s inner plexiform layer: an arbor segregation principle governing structure along the light axis and a density conservation principle governing structure in the tangential plane. Structure is related to visual function; ganglion cells with arbors near the layer of ganglion cell somas are more sustained in their visual responses on average. Our methods are potentially applicable to dense maps of neuronal anatomy and physiology in other parts of the nervous system.},

Visual responses of a subset of pyramidal cells are included. The data are publicly available, along with tools for programmatic and three-dimensional interactive access. Brief vignettes illustrate the breadth of potential applications relating structure to function in cortical circuits and neuronal cell biology. Mitochondria and synapse organization are characterized as a function of path length from the soma. Pyramidal connectivity motif frequencies are predicted accurately using a configuration model of random graphs. Pyramidal cells receiving more connections from nearby cells exhibit stronger and more reliable visual responses. Sample code shows data access and analysis.},

With the basic architecture of the nervous system preserved, structural changes in neurons, large or small, were closely associated with connectivity changes, which in turn evoked dauer-specific behaviors such as nictation. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant dauer-specific rewiring of sensory neuron connectivity and increased clustering within motor neurons in the dauer connectome. We suggest that the nervous system in the nematode has evolved to respond to harsh environments by developing a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated connectome.},

Proofreading of whole-brain automated reconstructions will require many person-years of effort, due to the huge volumes of data involved. Here we present FlyWire, an online community for proofreading neural circuits in a Drosophila melanogaster brain and explain how its computational and social structures are organized to scale up to whole-brain connectomics. Browser-based three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible to distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually anywhere in the world. Information in the edit history is programmatically accessible for a variety of uses such as estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive systems. An open community accelerates proofreading by recruiting more participants and accelerates scientific discovery by requiring information sharing. We demonstrate how FlyWire enables circuit analysis by reconstructing and analyzing the connectome of mechanosensory neurons.},

abstract="Electron microscopy (EM) enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at the level of individual synapses, which has been transformative for scientific discoveries. However, due to the complex morphology, an accurate reconstruction of cortical axons has become a major challenge. Worse still, there is no publicly available large-scale EM dataset from the cortex that provides dense ground truth segmentation for axons, making it difficult to develop and evaluate large-scale axon reconstruction methods. To address this, we introduce the AxonEM dataset, which consists of two 30 x 30 x 30 μm3 EM image volumes from the human and mouse cortex, respectively. We thoroughly proofread over 18,000 axon instances to provide dense 3D axon instance segmentation, enabling large-scale evaluation of axon reconstruction methods. In addition, we densely annotate nine ground truth subvolumes for training, per each data volume. With this, we reproduce two published state-of-the-art methods and provide their evaluation results as a baseline. We publicly release our code and data at https://connectomics-bazaar.github.io/proj/AxonEM/index.html to foster the development of advanced methods.",

abstract = "Benefiting from the rapid development of electron microscopy imaging and deep learning technologies, an increasing number of brain image datasets with segmentation and synapse detection are published. Most of the automated segmentation methods label voxels rather than producing neuron skeletons directly. A further skeletonization step is necessary for quantitative morphological analysis. Currently, several tools are published for skeletonization as well as morphological and synaptic connectivity analysis using different computer languages and environments. Recently the Julia programming language, notable for elegant syntax and high performance, has gained rapid adoption in the scientific computing community. Here, we present a Julia package, called RealNeuralNetworks.jl, for efficient sparse skeletonization, morphological analysis, and synaptic connectivity analysis. Based on a large-scale Zebrafish segmentation dataset, we illustrate the software features by performing distributed skeletonization in Google Cloud, clustering the neurons using the NBLAST algorithm, combining morphological similarity and synaptic connectivity to study their relationship. We demonstrate that RealNeuralNetworks.jl is suitable for use in terabyte-scale electron microscopy image segmentation datasets.",

  abstract = "The reconstruction of neural circuits from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) images is being accelerated by automatic image segmentation methods. Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.",
