abstract = {When 3D electron microscopy and calcium imaging are used to investigate the structure and function of neural circuits, the resulting datasets pose new challenges of visualization and interpretation. Here, we present a new kind of digital resource that encompasses almost 400 ganglion cells from a single patch of mouse retina. An online "museum" provides a 3D interactive view of each cell's anatomy, as well as graphs of its visual responses. The resource reveals two aspects of the retina's inner plexiform layer: an arbor segregation principle governing structure along the light axis and a density conservation principle governing structure in the tangential plane. Structure is related to visual function; ganglion cells with arbors near the layer of ganglion cell somas are more sustained in their visual responses on average. Our methods are potentially applicable to dense maps of neuronal anatomy and physiology in other parts of the nervous system.},

With the basic architecture of the nervous system preserved, structural changes in neurons, large or small, were closely associated with connectivity changes, which in turn evoked dauer-specific behaviors such as nictation. Graph theoretical analyses revealed significant dauer-specific rewiring of sensory neuron connectivity and increased clustering within motor neurons in the dauer connectome. We suggest that the nervous system in the nematode has evolved to respond to harsh environments by developing a quantitatively and qualitatively differentiated connectome.},

Browser-based three-dimensional interactive segmentation by collaborative editing of a spatially chunked supervoxel graph makes it possible to distribute proofreading to individuals located virtually anywhere in the world. Information in the edit history is programmatically accessible for a variety of uses such as estimating proofreading accuracy or building incentive systems.

abstract="Electron microscopy (EM) enables the reconstruction of neural circuits at the level of individual synapses, which has been transformative for scientific discoveries. However, due to the complex morphology, an accurate reconstruction of cortical axons has become a major challenge. Worse still, there is no publicly available large-scale EM dataset from the cortex that provides dense ground truth segmentation for axons, making it difficult to develop and evaluate large-scale axon reconstruction methods. To address this, we introduce the AxonEM dataset, which consists of two 30 x 30 x 30 μm3 EM image volumes from the human and mouse cortex, respectively. We thoroughly proofread over 18,000 axon instances to provide dense 3D axon instance segmentation, enabling large-scale evaluation of axon reconstruction methods. In addition, we densely annotate nine ground truth subvolumes for training, per each data volume. With this, we reproduce two published state-of-the-art methods and provide their evaluation results as a baseline. We publicly release our code and data at https://connectomics-bazaar.github.io/proj/AxonEM/index.html to foster the development of advanced methods.",

Currently, several tools are published for skeletonization as well as morphological and synaptic connectivity analysis using different computer languages and environments. Recently the Julia programming language, notable for elegant syntax and high performance, has gained rapid adoption in the scientific computing community. Here, we present a Julia package, called RealNeuralNetworks.jl, for efficient sparse skeletonization, morphological analysis, and synaptic connectivity analysis. Based on a large-scale Zebrafish segmentation dataset, we illustrate the software features by performing distributed skeletonization in Google Cloud, clustering the neurons using the NBLAST algorithm, combining morphological similarity and synaptic connectivity to study their relationship. We demonstrate that RealNeuralNetworks.jl is suitable for use in terabyte-scale electron microscopy image segmentation datasets.",

Segmentation accuracy is often limited by the preceding step of aligning 2D section images to create a 3D image stack. Precise and robust alignment in the presence of image artifacts is challenging, especially as datasets are attaining the petascale. We present a computational pipeline for aligning ssEM images with several key elements. Self-supervised convolutional nets are trained via metric learning to encode and align image pairs, and they are used to initialize iterative fine-tuning of alignment. A procedure called vector voting increases robustness to image artifacts or missing image data. For speedup the series is divided into blocks that are distributed to computational workers for alignment. The blocks are aligned to each other by composing transformations with decay, which achieves a global alignment without resorting to a time-consuming global optimization. We apply our pipeline to a whole fly brain dataset, and show improved accuracy relative to prior state of the art. We also demonstrate that our pipeline scales to a cubic millimeter of mouse visual cortex. Our pipeline is publicly available through two open source Python packages.",

abstract = {Abstract As an animal matures, its neural circuit undergoes alterations, yet the developmental changes in intracellular organelles to facilitate these changes is less understood. Using 3D electron microscopy and deep learning, the study develops semi-automated methods for reconstructing mitochondria in C. elegans and collected mitochondria reconstructions from normal reproductive stages and dauer, enabling comparative study on mitochondria structure within the neuromuscular system. It is found that various mitochondria structural properties in neurons correlate with synaptic connections and these properties are preserved across development in different neural circuits. To test the necessity of these universal mitochondria properties, the study examines the behavior in drp-1 mutants with impaired mitochondria fission and discovers that it causes behavioral deficits. Moreover, it is observed that dauer neurons display distinctive mitochondrial features, and mitochondria in dauer muscles exhibit unique reticulum-like structure. It is proposed that these specialized mitochondria structures may serve as an adaptive mechanism to support stage-specific behavioral and physiological needs.},

These cell types have been mapped systematically using a variety of molecular, electrophysiological and morphological approaches1--4. Each modality offers new perspectives on the variation of biological processes underlying cell-type specialization. Cellular-scale electron microscopy provides dense ultrastructural examination and an unbiased perspective on the subcellular organization of brain cells, including their synaptic connectivity and nanometre-scale morphology. In data that contain tens of thousands of neurons, most of which have incomplete reconstructions, identifying cell types becomes a clear challenge for analysis5. Here, to address this challenge, we present a systematic survey of the somatic region of all cells in a cubic millimetre of cortex using quantitative features obtained from electron microscopy. This analysis demonstrates that the perisomatic region is sufficient to identify cell types, including types defined primarily on the basis of their connectivity patterns. We then describe how this classification facilitates cell-type-specific connectivity characterization and locating cells with rare connectivity patterns in the dataset.},

abstract={We are in the era of millimetre-scale electron microscopy volumes collected at nanometre resolution1,2. Dense reconstruction of cellular compartments in these electron microscopy volumes has been enabled by recent advances in machine learning3--6. Automated segmentation methods produce exceptionally accurate reconstructions of cells, but post hoc proofreading is still required to generate large connectomes that are free of merge and split errors. The elaborate 3D meshes of neurons in these volumes contain detailed morphological information at multiple scales, from the diameter, shape and branching patterns of axons and dendrites, down to the fine-scale structure of dendritic spines. However, extracting these features can require substantial effort to piece together existing tools into custom workflows. Here, building on existing open source software for mesh manipulation, we present Neural Decomposition (NEURD), a software package that decomposes meshed neurons into compact and extensively annotated graph representations. With these feature-rich graphs, we automate a variety of tasks such as state-of-the-art automated proofreading of merge errors, cell classification, spine detection, axonal-dendritic proximities and other annotations. These features enable many downstream analyses of neural morphology and connectivity, making these massive and complex datasets more accessible to neuroscience researchers.},

abstract={Mammalian cortex features a vast diversity of neuronal cell types, each with characteristic anatomical, molecular and functional properties1. Synaptic connectivity shapes how each cell type participates in the cortical circuit, but mapping connectivity rules at the resolution of distinct cell types remains difficult. Here we used millimetre-scale volumetric electron microscopy2 to investigate the connectivity of all inhibitory neurons across a densely segmented neuronal population of 1,352 cells spanning all layers of mouse visual cortex, producing a wiring diagram of inhibition with more than 70,000 synapses. Inspired by classical neuroanatomy, we classified inhibitory neurons based on targeting of dendritic compartments and developed an excitatory neuron classification based on dendritic reconstructions with whole-cell maps of synaptic input. Single-cell connectivity showed a class of disinhibitory specialist that targets basket cells. Analysis of inhibitory connectivity onto excitatory neurons found widespread specificity, with many interneurons exhibiting differential targeting of spatially intermingled subpopulations. Inhibitory targeting was organized into `motif groups', diverse sets of cells that collectively target both perisomatic and dendritic compartments of the same excitatory targets. Collectively, our analysis identified new organizing principles for cortical inhibition and will serve as a foundation for linking contemporary multimodal neuronal atlases with the cortical wiring diagram.},

abstract={Understanding the relationship between circuit connectivity and function is crucial for uncovering how the brain computes. In mouse primary visual cortex, excitatory neurons with similar response properties are more likely to be synaptically connected1--8; however, broader connectivity rules remain unknown. Here we leverage the millimetre-scale MICrONS dataset to analyse synaptic connectivity and functional properties of neurons across cortical layers and areas. Our results reveal that neurons with similar response properties are preferentially connected within and across layers and areas---including feedback connections---supporting the universality of `like-to-like' connectivity across the visual hierarchy. Using a validated digital twin model, we separated neuronal tuning into feature (what neurons respond to) and spatial (receptive field location) components. We found that only the feature component predicts fine-scale synaptic connections beyond what could be explained by the proximity of axons and dendrites. We also discovered a higher-order rule whereby postsynaptic neuron cohorts downstream of presynaptic cells show greater functional similarity than predicted by a pairwise like-to-like rule. Recurrent neural networks trained on a simple classification task develop connectivity patterns that mirror both pairwise and higher-order rules, with magnitudes similar to those in MICrONS data. Ablation studies in these recurrent neural networks reveal that disrupting like-to-like connections impairs performance more than disrupting random connections. These findings suggest that these connectivity principles may have a functional role in sensory processing and learning, highlighting shared principles between biological and artificial systems.},

abstract={Neural circuit function is shaped both by the cell types that comprise the circuit and the connections between them1. Neural cell types have previously been defined by morphology2,3, electrophysiology4, transcriptomic expression5,6, connectivity7--9 or a combination of such modalities10--12. The Patch-seq technique enables the characterization of morphology, electrophysiology and transcriptomic properties from individual cells13--15. These properties were integrated to define 28 inhibitory, morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET) cell types in mouse visual cortex16, which do not include synaptic connectivity. Conversely, large-scale electron microscopy (EM) enables morphological reconstruction and a near-complete description of a neuron's local synaptic connectivity, but does not include transcriptomic or electrophysiological information. Here, we leveraged morphological information from Patch-seq to predict the transcriptomically defined cell subclass and/or MET-type of inhibitory neurons within a large-scale EM dataset. We further analysed Martinotti cells---a somatostatin (Sst)-positive17 morphological cell type18,19---which were classified successfully into Sst MET-types with distinct axon myelination and synaptic output connectivity patterns. We demonstrate that morphological features can be used to link cell types across experimental modalities, enabling further comparison of connectivity to gene expression and electrophysiology. We observe unique connectivity rules for predicted Sst cell types.},

abstract={Advances in electron microscopy, image segmentation and computational infrastructure have given rise to large-scale and richly annotated connectomic datasets, which are increasingly shared across communities. To enable collaboration, users need to be able to concurrently create annotations and correct errors in the automated segmentation by proofreading. In large datasets, every proofreading edit relabels cell identities of millions of voxels and thousands of annotations like synapses. For analysis, users require immediate and reproducible access to this changing and expanding data landscape. Here we present the Connectome Annotation Versioning Engine (CAVE), a computational infrastructure that provides scalable solutions for proofreading and flexible annotation support for fast analysis queries at arbitrary time points. Deployed as a suite of web services, CAVE empowers distributed communities to perform reproducible connectome analysis in up to petascale datasets ({\textasciitilde}1{\thinspace}mm3) while proofreading and annotating is ongoing.},

abstract={Neurons in the neocortex exhibit astonishing morphological diversity, which is critical for properly wiring neural circuits and giving neurons their functional properties. However, the organizational principles underlying this morphological diversity remain an open question. Here, we took a data-driven approach using graph-based machine learning methods to obtain a low-dimensional morphological ``bar code'' describing more than 30,000 excitatory neurons in mouse visual areas V1, AL, and RL that were reconstructed from the millimeter scale MICrONS serial-section electron microscopy volume. Contrary to previous classifications into discrete morphological types (m-types), our data-driven approach suggests that the morphological landscape of cortical excitatory neurons is better described as a continuum, with a few notable exceptions in layers 5 and 6. Dendritic morphologies in layers 2--3 exhibited a trend towards a decreasing width of the dendritic arbor and a smaller tuft with increasing cortical depth. Inter-area differences were most evident in layer 4, where V1 contained more atufted neurons than higher visual areas. Moreover, we discovered neurons in V1 on the border to layer 5, which avoided deeper layers with their dendrites. In summary, we suggest that excitatory neurons' morphological diversity is better understood by considering axes of variation than using distinct m-types.},
